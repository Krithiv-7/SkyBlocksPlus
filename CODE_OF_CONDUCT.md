# SkyBlocks+ Community Code of Conduct

This document defines the behavior expected from every member of the SkyBlocks+ community. Our goal is to create an environment that is welcoming, respectful, and productive for all participants. By engaging in the project—through issue reporting, discussions, code contributions, or other interactions—you agree to abide by the following guidelines.

## DO

- **Search Before You Act:**  
  Always search existing issues first to prevent redundant reports and discussions.
  
- **Report Responsibly:**  
  Report bugs, security vulnerabilities, and other issues concerning the modpack using the proper channels provided.
  
- **Contribute Constructively:**  
  Suggest mods, propose changes, and offer enhancements for the modpack. Ensure your suggestions are clear, precise, and backed with rationale.
  
- **Engage in Open Discussions:**  
  Participate in discussions on open issues—especially those marked as "feedback" or "testers wanted"—to improve overall quality.
  
- **Submit Quality Pull Requests:**  
  When contributing code (e.g., improvements to CLI scripts or other reliability enhancements), ensure your pull requests are well-documented and adhere to the project’s standards.

## DO NOT

- **Misuse the Issue Tracker:**  
  Do not use the issue tracker for generic questions; these should be directed to our Discord server or appropriate communication channels.
  
- **Address Illegitimate Topics:**  
  Do not report or discuss topics related to hacked clients, piracy, or any unauthorized modifications.
  
- **Bypass Discussion Processes:**  
  Avoid directly submitting pull requests for major modpack structure changes (e.g., adding new mods) without initiating a discussion via an issue.
  
- **Submit Improper Localization Changes:**  
  Do not create pull requests for localization modifications unless you have followed the specified localization contribution guidelines.
  
- **Disrespect Other Community Members:**  
  Ensure that all interactions remain respectful and professional. Do not tolerate personal attacks, derogatory language, or any form of harassment.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:
- A warning or temporary suspension from the community.
- Permanent exclusion from participation if abusive behavior continues.
  
All enforcement actions are at the discretion of the project moderators and maintainers. If you believe a violation has occurred, please reach out confidentially to a moderator.

## Reporting Misconduct

If you observe behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:
1. **Document the Incident:**  
   Collect relevant data or descriptions outlining the issue.
2. **Report It:**  
   Submit your report via the designated channels (e.g., Discord, GitHub discussions) directly to a moderator.
3. **Abide by Subsequent Guidance:**  
   Allow the moderation team to investigate and resolve the issue. All reports will be treated in confidence.

## Acknowledgment

By participating in the SkyBlocks+ community, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct and help to promote a friendly and inclusive environment for all.
